# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

In this project, we created a web application that scrapes various websites to produce data about the Mission to Mars. We stored the data on MongoDB and displayed on a HTML page. We pulled in the latest Mars News, Featured Mars Image, Mars Facts, and high resolution images and links to the Mars Hemispheres. 

# Web Application
